            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Speedometer : </b> This is the most common and important feature which is used by the driver
                    since it represents the speed of the car.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>tachometer : </b> This is the also an important feature which is used by the driver since it
                    represents the number of rotation per minute and this tell the performance of the engine.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Fuel Indicator : </b> This is an important feature which is used to represent the fuel level and
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Left/Right Signals : </b> This feature is used when the driver has to take a turn Left/Right.
                    This is important because it gives information to other drivers about the turn the driver making. It
                    helps in reducing the accidents.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Hazard Lights : </b> This feature is used when the driver has to Park and to notify other
                    vehicles about the presence of the car. This represents that the car has some issues.<br>

        <h3>Rare Uses of a Car Dashboards:</h3>
        <div class="ml-5 mt-4">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Park/Drive/Reverse Indicator : </b> This represents the mode of the car. Since driver knows the
                    mode he is in, this feature is very rarely used ny the driver.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Mileage Indicator : </b> This represents the mode of the car. Since driver knows the mode he is
                    in, this feature is very rarely used by the driver.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Steering Lock Indicator : </b> This indicator turns on when the steering gets locked. This
                    happens very rarly and with constant checkup this feature is almost never used by the driver.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cruice Control Indicator : </b> This indicator turns on when the car enters into cruice control
                    mode. Since driver makes the decision of on/off cruice control it is also rarly used.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Extra Speedometer : </b> Some interfaces has duel speedometer display (MPH & KMPH). Most of the
                    drivers are used to their respective region units, making duel speedometer is rarly used by the
                    driver.

        <h3>The Controls That The User Interacts With The Car Dashboards:</h3>
        <div class="ml-5 mt-4">
            Like mentioned in the "Most Common Features of Car Dashbaords", all these features interactes with the
            driver all the time.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Speedometer, Left/Right Signals, Fuel Indicator are the most common features that interact with
                    the driver when the driver is driving that car.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The Distance covered, Door Indicators, Engine Temperature are also important but not as frequently
                    interacted to the user compared to the above mentioned features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Hazard Lights and Resetting the distance covered are the two features also directly interacted
                    by the user. The User can turn on/off the hazard lights according to the need and the driver can
                    reset the total distance covered at anytime.
                </li>

        <h3>Common Mistakes With The Current designs:</h3>
        <div class="ml-5 mt-4">
            The current dashboard designs are prioritised accordign to the latest needs. Some missing the organization
            and some missing the staranderds and some are completly not relavent to the features. Like mentioned in the
            first section, those 5 dashboards have their own pros and cons but not one of the design has better way of
            helping driver in all possible ways.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the organization is perfect the speedometer and tachometer is not adjusted to the user
                    convenient. It is designed to make the dashboard pretty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the speedometer, tachometer, fuel indicator are well organised the rest of the indicatiors are
                    not particullarly designed to help the user to track those signals but to coverup the space in the
                    dashboard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Color representation is also not properly utilised because of using wrong color at wrong time
                    will defenity confuse the user at all time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making a congested dashboard might provide space for other requirments but it will not help the
                    driver at all. The representation should be well organized and should be easyly understandable by
                    the user.

        <h3>Improvements To make On The Control Interface:</h3>
        <div class="ml-5 mt-4">
            By considering all the pros and cons from the mentioned 5 dashboards, these are the best suggestions which
            makes the dashboard well organised and easily understandable by the driver.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Providing a place for all indicators in an order (alphabetically or commonly used indicators) makes
                    the user to easily tack the data.

                </li>
                <li>
                    By having larger speedometer and smaller tachometer helps user to track the speed without any delays
                    and makes user comfortable in getting the right information at right time.

                </li>
                <li>
                    By adding specific colors to the specific features also helps user to understand the importance of
                    the indicators.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The colors also help in tracking the importance of all the features so implementing the colors in
                    Speedometer, tachometer and fuel indicator will help the driver in getting the information faster
                    and helps the driver.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Insted of showing the door indicator that "Doors are open", showing which door is opend will help
                    driver to close that specific door. This helps driver in saving time insted of checking all the
                    doors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eventhough the Park/Drive/Reverse indicator is rarly used by the driver, making it with a large font
                    is essential because it represents the mode the car.
                </li>

        <h3>My Design for the Car Dashboard Control Interface:</h3>
        <div class="ml-5 mt-4">
            First as usual the driver has to start the engine. I provided two buttons, one for "Engine Start" and
            another for "Engine Stop".

            <br>
            <img src="./EngineStart.PNG" class="ml-5">
            <br>
            The orange border indicates the active button. If the engine is currently not running then "Engine Start"
            button will be active to start the engine. If the engine is running then "Engine Stop" will be active to
            stop the engine.
            Bellow case-1 represents that the Engine is stoped and case-2 represents the engine is currently running.

                </div>
            </div>
            The dashboard design is explained below. <br>
            The dashboard I designed has every aspect of pros and resolved cons of all 5 dashboards which are mentioned
            in first section.<br>
            The below picture represents the basic interface of my design.<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 30%;" class="mt-3 mb-5">
                <img src="./BasicInterface.PNG" class="ml-5 ">


            </div>
           
            Initially the car will be in Park mode and to move the car we have to change the mode to either Drive or
            Reverse. To change mode press "D" for Drive, "R" for reverse, "P" for parking.
            <div class="row mt-5">
                <div class="col-1"></div>
                <img src="./BasicInterface.PNG" class="col-3 ml-5">

                <img src="./DriveInterface.PNG" class=" col-3 ml-5">

                <img src="./ReverseInterface.PNG" class=" col-3 ml-5">
            </div>
            <div class="row ml-5 mb-5">
                <div class="col-1 ml-5"></div>

                <div class="col-2 ml-5">
                    <b class="ml-3">Park Mode</b>

                </div>
                <div class="col-1 ml-5"></div>

                <div class="col-2 ml-5">
                    <b> Drive Mode</b>

                </div>
                <div class="col-1 ml-5"></div>

                <div class="col-2">
                    <b> Reverse Mode</b>

                </div>
            </div>
            Once the Mode is changed, the user can press "Up arrow" key which is accelaration. The design has digital number representation and color representation aswell. When the speed is between o-59, it shows green color. When the speed is between 60-119, it shows yellow. When the speed is between 120-180, it shows red color.
            <br><br>
            Similarly the Tachometer also changes color at intervels 3 and 6 i.e, 0-3 RPM will give green color, 3-6 it gives Yellow and 6-9 gives red color.
            <br><br>
            Simultaniously the Fuel indicator also decreases the value since the vehical is moving. The color representation is implemented as if the fuel is full then it shows green color. As fuel is decreased by 30% then the color is changed to yellow and if it is at last 30% it is represented with red color.
            <br><br>
            All these are shown in the below screenshots.

            </div>
            The Cruice Control is also implemented in this design. By pressing "c" key the cruice control actives. At the bottom the interface the Cruice Control indicator is enabled when the cruice control is activated. By pressing "c" again will disable the cruice control.
            <div style="margin-left: 30%;" class="mt-3 mb-5">

            The Indicators on either side of the screen so that the driver can easily track the indicators and it
            doesn't take much time to understand the indicator.
            <div style="margin-left: 20%;" class="mt-3 mb-5">
                <img src="./IndicatorInterface.PNG" class="ml-5 ">


            </div>
            I have implemented the checking page to check the indicators working status. All the indicators are validated through this page. To refill the fuel or the buttons for hazard lights and to reset the total distance are implemented in this page.
            <div style="margin-left: 30%;" class="mt-3 mb-5">

            </div>
            
            By clicking each button that represented button gets activated which represents that specific indicator has issues and it blincks with red color. By clicking it again, the interface takes it as the issue is resolved and the indicator will go back to normal.
            <div style="margin-left: 30%;" class="mt-3 mb-5">
                <img src="./IndicatorChecking.gif" class="ml-5 ">

            </div>
            This design has hazard light implementation also. By clicking the hazard button from checking page the both Left and Right indicators stats blinking. This hazard light active indicator is showed at the bottom of the interface beside cruice control indicator.
            <div style="margin-left: 30%;" class="mt-3 mb-5">
                <img src="./HazardLight.gif" class="ml-5 ">
